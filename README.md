This repository demonstrates an uncommon MATLAB error related to the handling of NaN (Not a Number) values within conditional statements. The `myFunction.m` file contains a function with a conditional logic that behaves unexpectedly when provided with NaN input. The `bugSolution.m` file offers a corrected version that addresses the issue. The primary issue stems from the fact that comparisons involving NaN always evaluate to false, regardless of the other operand. This can lead to unintended code paths being executed or unexpected results in the output. The solution involves explicit checks for NaN values before proceeding with the conditional logic.
